# CodeChallenge

This app perfom requests to The Movie DB API to fetch upcoming movies (using pagination), it also perform querys to find nice movies :) 
I am using MVC pattern and to remove some responsibilities from View Controllers, i have created a Service Layer and a Network Layer.

## Pods

For this project, I have decided to use Alamofire to handle HTTP Requests, Kingfisher to handle images, and SwiftyJSON to help me parsing objects. I am also using Swift lint, because it helps me program better.
